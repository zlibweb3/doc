# Z-Library web3
Through the years, Z-Library has been under threats of closing down. As a counter measure, the books and articles are now stored on IPFS, which is awesome.

However, metadata of Z-Library is still at risk. Even if the books and articles are preserved on IPFS, without metadata, they will be there without a context and be hard to find.

Z-Library web3 aims to store the metadata of the book portfolio on blockchain as a safety measure.
